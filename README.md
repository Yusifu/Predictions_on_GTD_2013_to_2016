Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information 
on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2014. Some portion 
of the attacks have not been attributed to a particular terrorist group.

Use attack type, weapons used, description of the attack, etc. to build a
model that can predict what group may have been responsible for an incident.
